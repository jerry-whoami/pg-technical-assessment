# Explainability

## What We Explain

We want to understand which input features most strongly influence delivery time predictions, based on the trained XGBoost model.

## Method

- Used XGBoostâ€™s built-in **feature importance (gain)**, which measures how much each feature contributes to improving accuracy when used in splits.
- Visualized results with a bar chart of importance scores.

## Findings

### Key Insights

- **Distance_km** is by far the most influential feature (importance = 0.159893).  
- **Traffic_Level** (0.088763) and **Preparation_Time_min** (0.087417) are also strong contributors.  
- **Weather_Snowy** (0.087840) shows that adverse weather can rival traffic in its effect on delivery time.
- **Preparation_Time_min**: (0.087417) Adds a consistent baseline offset to delivery time.
- **Order_ID** has negligible value, confirming it is just an identifier.  
- Other features (vehicle type, courier experience, time of day) have smaller but still meaningful contributions.  
- Weather effects outweigh time-of-day effects, meaning conditions matter more than scheduling.  
- Scooters slightly outperform cars and bikes, showing a marginal advantage.
