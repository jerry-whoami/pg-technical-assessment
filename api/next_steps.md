# Next Steps

Production Readiness Plan â€” Delivery Time Predictor API

---

## API Hardening

- Add `/live` and `/ready` endpoints separate from `/health`.
- Return model/API version in responses.
- Improve error handling with clear messages.

## Validation

- Reject invalid inputs with 400 status codes.

## Observability

- Add structured logging with request IDs.
- Expose `/metrics` for latency, error rate, and throughput.
- Alert on SLO breaches.

## Performance

- Warm up the model at startup.
- Configure workers and timeouts.
- Test under load to confirm latency targets.

## Security

- Require authentication (API key or token).
- Use secrets from environment/secret manager.
- Avoid logging sensitive data.

## Configuration

- Control paths, versions, and limits via environment variables.
- Provide `.env.example` with defaults.

## Testing

- Unit tests for validation and service functions.
- Integration tests for endpoints.
- Load tests for performance.
- Contract tests for schema compatibility.

## Deployment

- Containerize with non-root user and health probes.
- Use autoscaling with load balancer.
- Support safe rollout (canary).
- Maintain rollback procedure.

## Model Management

- Save model with preprocessing pipeline and metadata.
- Expose `MODEL_VERSION` in responses.
- Store artifacts in a central registry.

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- Track latency, error rates, and data drift.
- Compute MAE against actuals when ground truth is available.
- Set up alerts for degradation.
- Schedule retraining when drift/performance issues appear.

## Documentation

- Write API reference with examples.
- Create runbook for deploy/rollback and common issues.
